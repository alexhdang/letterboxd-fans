# letterboxd-fans
Ranks films on <a href = "http://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> by percentage of fans out of total watched.

Scrapes Letterboxd's first five pages of <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/films/popular/">most popular</a> and first five pages of <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/films/by/rating/">top rated</a> films, gathering all the URLs.
Then, scrapes each URL to find number of fans and number of people who watched each film.
Being a fan of a film on Letterboxd means it is one of the four "Favorite Films" on a user's profile, as can be seen <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/alda/">here on my profile</a>.
Congregates all this information into an unsorted CSV file.

With the CSV file, I went into Excel and manually sorted the films by percent fans out of watched. That file can be viewed <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S3puCkyzj7PQp9E-Bo2J0EwYFqAe4OU0B-bdNMujdhA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
