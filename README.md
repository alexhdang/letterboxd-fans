# letterboxd-fans
Ranks films on <a href = "http://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> by percentage of fans out of total watched.

Scrapes Letterboxd's first five pages of <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/films/popular/">most popular</a> and first five pages of <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/films/by/rating/">top rated</a> films, gathering all the URLs.
Then, scrapes each URL to find number of fans and number of people who watched each film.
Congregates all this information into an unsorted csv file.

After that, I went into Excel and manually sorted the films by percent fans out of watched. That file can be viewed <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S3puCkyzj7PQp9E-Bo2J0EwYFqAe4OU0B-bdNMujdhA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
